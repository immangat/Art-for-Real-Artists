# Artistic Realms - Website for Real Artists

Artistic Realms is a website I'm building to practice my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Next.js, and React. The website is dedicated to real artists who want to showcase their work, connect with other creatives, and stay up-to-date on the latest art events and exhibitions.

## Features(That will totally be implemented)

Artistic Realms offers the following features for artists:

- **Gallery of Artwork**: A gallery section where artists can showcase their artwork and visitors can browse different categories of art such as painting, sculpture, photography, and digital art.
- **Artist Interviews**: Interviews with well-known artists, providing insights into their creative process, inspiration, and experiences.
- **Art Events and Exhibitions**: Information about upcoming art events and exhibitions, including those hosted by Artistic Realms.
- **Art Criticism and Reviews**: Reviews and criticism of new art pieces or exhibitions, promoting discourse around the artwork and providing feedback to artists.
- **Tutorials and Tips**: Tutorials and tips for artists on various art techniques, mediums, and tools.
- **Community Forum**: A community forum where artists can interact with each other, share ideas, collaborate, and provide feedback on each other's work.
- **Artist Profiles**: Artist profiles that highlight their biography, artwork, and achievements.

## Why I'm building this

I'm building Artistic Realms to practice my skills in web development and create a project that showcases my abilities.
